I won't be there, I won't play fair
In here somewhere, I will find my cause
I won't be there, no it's not my fair
I won't  be there, just to lose my cause

Instrumental

I won't be there. (repeat)

I'm going outside to play
I ain't gonna slave away
Not for no corporate Babylon
I'm never gonna be a pawn
In their manipulation games
Oh, Lord I'm taking the reins
I'm breaking the chains
I'm never gonna kneel, no way
My prophet is Heaven sent
No preacher or president can lead I astray
They'll never know
I'm taking Jah highway home
Oh, I've got my own path to follow
Don't know if you'll overstand
I've got my, my... my own truth to swallow
And you know that if I could
You know I would throw my guitar on my back
Pick up the slack, and leave here tomorrow
But I know that I am a pawn of Babylon
I got to face the facts, embrace the ax
And cut these chains off my sorrow
So I'm on a permanent holiday
I'm going outside to play
I ain't gonna slave away, no
Not for no corporate babylon
I'm never gonna be a pawn
In their manipulation games
Ten thousand years of captivity
We must eventually open up our eyes and see
They're manipulating we with so much uncertainty
And so many mysteries
Why are so few questioning the unnatural state of things?
It's a nightmare
We're living in a nightmar
Everyone's living so scared
They're virtually unaware
Of this fear that rules their lives
Occupies, consumes their minds
This fear of bankruptcy
Financial impotancy
It's funny money, money, money
It's all this digital currency, woah, yeah
It's all this monopoly money
That keeps us from ever being free, ooh-oh-yaeh
And so it seems we'll be in this prison for life
'Cause if we keep buying then they'll keep selling the lie
So it's up to I and I
I... nip..., mind... and...
I... Rev..., make... cel...
I... change... man... words...
I... be...
I... own...
I... (be) nip...(late), mind... and...
I... (seek) Rev... (lation), make... (life) cel... (bration)

I (won't be) manip... (ulated), mind (controlled) and in... (undated)
I (will seek) the reve... (lation), make (my life) a cele... (bration)
I (will be) the change (I'm seeking), mani... (fest) the words (I'm speaking)
I (refuse) to be (imprisoned) I (will make) my own (decisions)
Oh, Lord
I won't be manipulated
Mind-controlled and inundated
I will seek the revelation
Make my life a celebration
I'm gonna be the change I'm seeking
Manifest the words I'm speaking
I refuse to be imprisoned
I will make my own decisions
I'm on a permanent holiday
I'm going outside to play
I ain't gonna slave away, no
Not for no corporate babylon
I'm never gonna be a pawn
In their manipulation games
Oh Lord, I'm taking the reins
I'm breaking the chains
I'm never gonna kneel, no way
My prophet is Heaven sent
No preacher or president can lead I astray
We'll never know
I'm taking Jah highway home
Ooh, I'll never go astray with na-na-na...
I'm leaving the past
And forwarding fast
'Cause freedom is here to stay
Oh, Lord we got to take back the knowledge
We got to take back the power
We got to take back the knowledge
We got to take back the power, oh-yeah
We got to take back the knowledge
To take back the power
Take back what they have stolen from our hearts
And we got to take back the esoteric knowledge
Oh, Lord for too long they've been keeping us apart
Oh yes, we got to take back the knowledge
Take back the power
Humanity don't let this be our final hour
Take back the knowledge
Take back the power
Humanity don't let this be our final hour
We got to take back the knowledge
Take back the power
Humanity don't let this be our final hour
Take back the knowledge
Take back the power
Humanity don't let this be our final hour

Топити за культуру стало модно так часом
І винити кожного у своїх же невдачах
Я, як глядач, дивився, аж допоки не настав час
Коли ви вкотре винуваті, не пробачу знову вас
І слухай

[Куплет 2]
Ти крутиш спіннер, я кручу йо-йо
Я кручу світ цей, ти кажеш йоу-йоу
Я Прометей - я дарую вогонь
Ти "Прометей" - лайнове кіно
І я не про людей, я про ваші потуги
Ви можливо хороші, та ліхтарики стухли
Ваше "мистецтво" для поп-сцени і лайножерів
Ті хто роблять справжню музику ніколи не збрешуть
Ніби Гей, все для людей (воу)
Я всім вам розкажу (ага)
Почекайте будь-ласка, я ці гроші всі зараз у стіл приберу (дідько)
Стривай-но, постійте, адже це справді кошерно
Світити мордою в екрані й будувати маєтки
І ось це ваші думки, рани, шрами душевні
Чи ви дійсно дурні, ви вважаєте ця гниль і є мистецтво?

[Приспів]
Я до вас не опущусь, (ні)
Поки йокає сердце (ей)
Я до вас не опущусь (ні)
Поки йокає сердце
І це мистецтво?
Я до вас не опущусь, (ні)
Поки йокає сердце (ага)
Я до вас не опущусь (ні)
Поки йокає сердце (дідько)
І це мистецтво?
[Куплет 3]
І, знаєш, знаєш я всім йду наперекір
Ты слова ковтаєш, а я мчу немов би звір
Рахуєш гроші, дідько, та який з тебе банкір
Ти руки ховаєш, ще кишені перевір
Коли мене помічаєш, то на декілька миль
Від мене ти тікаєш летять з тебе копійки
Щось небачу я тих клятих доларів
Про які ти говорив, ти брехло як і вони
Немає гідних артистів
Не захиститися вам, затям
Ви жалюгідні безкістні
Мій хист, бійся, він буде завжди йти по головам (дідько)
І ви риєте, риєте яму молодим
І ви риєте, риєте, риєте
І ви риєте, риєте яму мені
Але самі у ній і згинете

[Пред-Приспів)
І це мистецтво?

[Приспів]
Я до вас не опущусь, (ні)
Поки йокає сердце (ей)
Я до вас не опущусь (ні)
Поки йокає сердце
І це мистецтво?
Я до вас не опущусь (ні)
Поки йокає сердце (ага)
Я до вас не опущусь (ні)
Поки йокає сердце (дідько)]]

			It's hard where you're living
Adding weight to make it balanced
Saying it could be too much
But he's clasping to his tie
There was a finer life
When I was with my friends and I could always see my family
That's what I still want now
Even if I'm here and I know they won't be waiting
Cause I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be here alone
While you're there give back a little more
The return could make you notice
That I'm thinking of a moment
And know its still sound
There was a finer life when you were with us here
And we knew there was a next time
That's what I still want now
Even if I'm there and I think that you won't be waiting
Cause I don't want to be alone
It's hard where you're living

Sometimes a man [x4]

You would’ve known I do in the rapture
There was no way to move any faster
Because we stay stuck in one place with nothing to do
And sometimes the sediment is true

Sometimes a man ain’t what he says he is
Sometimes a man is just a man
Is just a man, ain’t what he says he is

We celebrate the birth on winter’s pattern
While really rising Earth to Saturn's power
And we are slaves trapped inside our own fears
So misbehave and suffer when we’re dead
We’re just infected without a cure

Sometimes a man ain’t what he says he is
Sometimes a man is just a man
Is just a man, ain’t what he says he is

Sometimes a man is just a man
Sometimes a man ain’t what he says he is [x2]

Don’t leave me hanging on [x3]
Don’t leave me hanging today

I don’t want to be left behind
Everyone’s the same
God don’t play favorites, right?

Who knows what to believe in anymore? [x2]

Sometimes a man ain’t what he says he is
Sometimes a man is just a man
Is just a man, ain’t what he says he is

Don’t leave me hanging on [x7]

While everyone is minus, you could call me multiply
Just so you know, yes, yes, I'm that guy
You could get five fingers and I'm not waving "hi"
Guess I'm never-ending, you could call me pi
But really, how long till the world realize
Yes, yes I'm the best, fuck what you heard
Anything less is obviously absurd
Haters get the bird, more like an eagle
This is my movie, stay tuned for the sequel
Seems so wrong, seems so illegal
Fellas in the back like a foul-ball free-throw
Yep, yep, you know that I go
This is me on the regular, so you know

I come with the tip, with the blow, with the boom
And if you're in my way, there's nothing but doom
Ain't got no time for you ratchet-ass goons
And just settle down, listen to my tunes
Ever since I was eight I was attached to the mic
Wanted a guitar before I wanted a bike
Had an Apple phone, fuck a Fisher-Price
Never see the sun 'cause I'm up all night (What)
Really, really? Really, really?
You want to talk shit but you know that I am illy?
Illy to the fullest, you can call me cancer
No multiple choice, 'cause I'm the only answer
Ain't got no wallet, only use rubber bands
You know my chick is ratchet 'cause that's what make a man
You wanna get at me, but you don't stand a chance
And if you wanna fuck, yes you can take your chance
Haters get the bird, more like an eagle
This is my movie, stay tuned for the sequel
Seems so wrong, seems so illegal
Fellas in the back like a foul-ball free-throw

Yep, yep, you know that I go
This is me on the regular, so you know
This is me on the regular, so you know
Five-foot-ten, about a buck twenty
Skinny as a rod but still wanna fuck with me
Wise ass nigga, you'd think I was fifty
But I take your fifty after you take this love see
Yep, yep, you know that I go
This is me on the regular, so you know
This is me on the regular, so you know
Don't try me, I'm not a free sample
Step to me and you will be handled
See, that's my crown on the mantle
And if you try to touch it, yes, there will be a scandal
Don't try me, I'm not a free sample
Step to me and you will be handled
See, that's my crown on the mantle
And if you try to touch it, yes, there will be a scandal
This is the end, but you really feeling it
Here's one more verse, 'cause I ain't no sleepy bitch
Ain't got much to say 'cause it's in my piece
Guess more hit the blunt and I ain't talking weed

Look at all the peaches
How do you celebrate?
Can't appear inside of nowhere
It's already dead

I'm not getting wet
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I'm not gettin' led along

And now I sleep 'side words you do not read with me
I hear a song from inside the maze, the very one you made
You shook at the ivory mantle

And in that braid you stay
